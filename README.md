## Description

This modpack will make life easier for developers of data and resource packs, speeding up their work. The modpack is aimed at introducing a large number of new features into the game that will help facilitate and speed up the development of your projects. Using the modpack is intended for playing in your own worlds, it is not recommended to use it on servers.


## Features (at the moment):
* Speeding up development
* Simplified work with commands
* Improved interaction with display entities
* Improved interaction with switching packs
* Improved interaction with NBT
* Improved interaction with worlds
* Improved interaction with the game window
* ...and much more to come

Below you can expand the list to see all the enabled mods and what each of them is for IN THIS MODPACK. Therefore, you have a choice which mods to disable. I will try to release the modpack update as soon as possible, but not all modders can release updates immediately after the game update, so I will try to replace the mods with those that are available for download on new versions of the game, and replace them in subsequent releases.
